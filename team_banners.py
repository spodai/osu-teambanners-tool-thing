# all written with gpt, but hey it works :D
# rundown what it does:
## downloads all files from a public Google folder
## puts them in an import folder
## slaps that data into a CSV: DATE | ORIGINAL FILE NAME | NEW FILE NAME | S-UL.EU URL
## asks for user input to rename files that are not listed yet in the CSV
## copies those renamed files to an export folder
## uploads the files that were renamed to s-ul.eu
## fills on the CSV with the renames and URLs
